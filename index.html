  <h1>I am six</h1>
   <body>An amazing website designed for 5 and 6 year olds. Fun, games, and more to explore. Information for grown ups: I am six is a revolutionary website designed to support your young child's learning and to encourage them to explore the internet, with all the reassurance parents need to ensure they are in a safe and age-appropriate environment. Whilst this website is designed especially for 5 and 6 year olds (beginning Key stage 1) the resources can be enjoyed by anyone aged 1 to 101. 

    This website will morph over time with 4 key themes being available at any one time. In December 2016 our key themes are: superheroes, astronomy, games, and your future. Perhaps encourage your six year old to spend time in one area per week? or choose their favourite each month?
